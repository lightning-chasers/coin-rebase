# End to colonialism!
Even if a queen's or monarch's head (of The Commonwealth Nations) were served on a tungsten plate, while it was barfing platinum or had a beard made of palladium, it wouldn't be enough reparation for the genocides committed by UK throughout the world over the past centuries! More over these genocides are still continuing as of this day in the form of proxy wars in Central and Middle-Eastern Asia, South America and in various African countries!

It isn't worth investing any trust or faith in the UK commonwealth government, in its fiat currency or in its agents!
